# Tracktime
## A Time Tracking GUI

### A simple time tracker, rough around the edges and more geared for short tasks.

### Double click the tracktime.py to launch the timer.

I have yet to turn this into a proper executable.

**Note:** 
- *This was built in a day or two, with a little help from Chat-GPT-3.*
  - *I think it was at that time Oct/Nov 2023.*

Feel free to drop me a message or leave an issue, or open a pull request if there's something to add or address.
I appreciate input, of the ethical sort, respectful comments only and then yes we can converse.

Enjoy your programming,
